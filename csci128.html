            <h3>Syllabus</h3>
            This is the law of the land
           <a href="csci128-syllabus.pdf">Official Syllabus</a>. But because you may not read it (very likley), here is
           my breakdown of it. **Note** this should only be used as a reference. Be sure to also READ THE OFFICIAL SYLLABUS!!!<br>
           <h4>Grade Breakdown</h4>
           | Letter | = [Min - Max)<br>========================<br>
           | A | = 90 - 100<br>
           | B+| = 87 - 90<br>
           | B | = 80 - 87<br>
           | C+| = 77 - 80<br>
           | C | = 70 - 77<br>
           | D+| = 67 - 70<br>
           | D | = 60 - 67<br>
           | F | = 0 - 60<br>
           ========================<br>
           * This scale is subject to change based on class preformance
           <footer></footer>
           <h3>Late Policy</h3>
           You get 5 late passes by default throughout the semeter on any assignment.
           Without a late pass or an <a href="https://www.mines.edu/student-life/student-absences/">excused absence</a> the following applies...<br><br>
           • 1 day late: -20% grade<br>
           • 2 days late: -40% grade<br>
           • 3 days late: -60% grade<br>
           • 4 or more days late: assignment is no longer accepted<br>
           <h4>My **Additional** Late Policy</h4>
           <p>I too was a Mines student who took this very class at one point and many of the classes you are in right now. I understand probably more than you know
            the rigor and pain that this school can bring at times.  
            With that said I still expect you all to try your best to get things in 
            within the due dates and use up your 5 late passes as needed. However, I will have the same policy as my favorite Mines Professor
            Keith Hellman which was this... 
            If you do run out of late passes 
            or are going through a rough patch, or have to study for a Calc 2 exam, etc. just send me 
            an email: <a href="mailto:jamesshima@mines.edu">jamesshima@mines.edu</a>. Explain your situation and I will most likley give you a personal extension
            within reason that I deem fit and fair for your situation.
