                Ah I see you know a little html.  Well because of your effort and clear curiosity, here is a 
                final note to you.  I really thought you were the one but something clearly changed in your head.
                Your fake genuineness and intentions gave me a lot to think about over our time together.
                I think you are bipolar as you always love bombed me then treated me like trash over the smallest things. This was truly highlighted 
                when I was truly suffering from the worst point in my life.  And the only thing you could do is critique me 
                instead of being the support I needed.  You weren't there for me when I needed you the most and always expected so much from me,
                giving me major anxiety.  I now realize how toxic our relationship was and I was too blinded by the idea of 
                marriage to see past these flaws.  I now realize I need to find someone who can love me for who I really am and that I don't have to 
                walk on eggshells around. That or just find happiness in myself, not a pointless relationship.
                I forgive you for everything and thank you for bringing me closer to God. I hope you seek help for your bipolarism.  
                I wish you the best with your future endevors and hope to see 
                you on the other side!<br><br>
                Goodbye for now.
