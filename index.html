        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is James Shima and welcome to my website! 
            I'm a student at Colorado School of Mines graduating with a B.S. in Computer Engineering by Dec 2023. 
            I've also been accepted into the CS Master's Program at Mines and will graduate from the program in Dec 2024. 
            On campus, I'm a part of ACM, CyberSec Club, a Student Ambassador and a Lead Computer Science TA. 
            In addition, have 1 year of industry experience from numerous software engineering internships. 
            In my free time I enjoy lifting weights, producing music, gaming, and working on cool projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        
        <h3>Exercise Classifier (Python/TensorFlow)</h3>
        <p>Developed proof of concept Convolutional Nueral Network to classify five different excercises.  
            This was done by preprosessing x,y,z axis acceleration data as a 3D tensor through a multilayered CNN. 
            Due to a current small dataset (less than 1000 samples) accuracy ranged from 86-95% depending on the distribution 
            of spliting the training and testing data.  Source code and more information can be found by <a href="https://github.com/jmshima01/TullyML">clicking here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Clue Game (Java)</h3>
        <p>Clue is a murder mystery board game for three to six players that was devised in 1943 by British board game designer 
            Anthony E. Pratt. The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the United Kingdom in 1949.  
            This project was created from the ground up using Java, JUnit, and Swing to create a single 
            player interpretation of the board game. To play the game, <a href="https://github.com/jmshima01/PlayClueGame"> click here</a> 
            and download either the Windows Executable or jar file to run with a Java Interpeter.</p>

        <h3>Web M.D. Plus (PostgreSQL/Python)</h3>
        <p>A fun clone of Web M.D. to practice desigining practical relational databases using PostgreSQL and Python.

    <h3>Multiband Low Frequency RF Jammer (C/C++)</h3>
    <p>Car theft is on the rise with criminals able to caputre and replicate the signal sent by your car keys with as little as 20$ worth of equipment.  
        But how can one protect themseleves from this?  
        This project aims to provides a solution by jamming the same band your car keys use, 
        preventing anyone from wirelessly accessing your car while the jammer is active and in range. <a href="https://github.com/jmshima01/SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib"> CC1101 Radio Library</a></p>
