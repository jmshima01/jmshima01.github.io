            <h4>Hello there!</h4>
            <p> Welcome to my website! I am a graduate student @ Colorado School of Mines. I also graduated with a B.S.
                in Computer Science from
                Mines in December, 2023. On campus, I have been a part of ACM, CyberSec Club, a Student Ambassador and a
                Lead Computer Science TA.
                In addition, have 1 year of industry experience from numerous software engineering internships.
                In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights, producing music, gaming, and working on cool projects.
