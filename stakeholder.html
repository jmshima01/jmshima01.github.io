							<h1>Stakeholder Engagement</h1>
							<h3>Our Focus - Amplifying the Voice of Host Communities </h3>
							<p>Inspired by the works of Jessica Smith and Fabiana Li, it has come to our understanding that members of host communities can oftentimes feel discouraged to speak up or misheard by the corporations operating in their areas. At Newmont, we consider host communities to be one of our most important stakeholders, as our operations have direct impacts on their lives. Because of this, we are working towards breaking down those walls and creating a convivial relationship between us. To do this, we plan on holding separate forums, town halls, and conferences for the community vs industry professionals. The key differences between these will be the level of professionalism as we intend on holding far more casual events with the community, emphasizing getting to know them as people rather than giving presentations and talks. By getting to know the community we can better understand their wants and needs and further cater our engagement efforts towards making a real impact.   </p>
						
							
							<h3>Our Approach</h3>
							<p>Stakeholders are at the center of everything we do. To be successful, we highly value the input of all stakeholders as we aim to uphold our values of safety, inclusion, integrity, responsibility, sustainability, and transparency. We recognize that different types of stakeholders hold different concerns, and therefore one form of engagement will not work for everyone. Therefore, we took it upon ourselves to identify our key stakeholders and create curated engagement plans for each group. 

								We consider any person or organization potentially impacted by our activities or influential to our success to be a stakeholder.  </p>
