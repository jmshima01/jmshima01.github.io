							<h3>Governance under “Value Sharing”</h3>
							<p>

								“A suite of global standards details Newmont's minimum requirements to effectively identify, manage and monitor our activities related to sharing the value created through our mining activities. Associated guidelines and procedures support teams with on-the-ground implementation and compliance. The management of our value-sharing approach is cross-functional, involving collaboration among the Finance, Human Resources, Supply Chain, Business Integrity and Compliance, and Sustainability and External Relations teams at the corporate, regional and site levels.  Members of our Executive Leadership Team are responsible for the day-to-day management of their respective areas. Each quarter, management reviews matters related to value sharing with the Board of Directors' committees (particularly the Safety and Sustainability, Audit, and Leadership Development and Compensation Committees), and the committee chairs apprise the full Board of any significant matters or developments.”  
								
							</p><h3>Strategy and Management Approach</h3> 
								
								<p>“We seek to positively impact socio-economic development where we operate and are committed to strong governance — including multi-stakeholder engagement and transparently disclosing payments to governments — to reduce risks and build accountability and trust.” 
								
								Taxes and Revenue 
								
								“The taxes and royalties we pay to national and local governments are important sources of income, particularly in countries where the mining and natural resources industries are significant contributors to the national economy. As part of our commitment to tax transparency, in 2022 we published our inaugural Taxes and Royalties Contribution Report. In addition to discussing our tax governance framework, strategy, approach to tax planning and stakeholder engagement, the report details Newmont’s significant economic contributions to host communities and governments. The disclosures in the report align with the requirements of the GRI 207: Tax 2019 global standard for tax transparency and the Australian government's Tax Transparency Code, a voluntary framework for businesses to detail their tax affairs. In 2022, we engaged with NGOs to discuss our tax transparency journey, and we plan to continue these discussions in 2023.”	 </p>
