								<h3>Engineering Excellence for Safety and Sustainability</h3>
								At Newmont, our dedicated team of Engineers and Applied Scientists assumes a critical responsibility in upholding industry-leading safety standards, driving sustainability initiatives, and championing the development of robust security measures. The complex nature of the extractives industry necessitates our engineers and scientists to continually innovate and implement technical solutions that advance and sustain these fundamental pillars.
							  
								Currently, our scientific team is actively spearheading projects with a focus on sustainability. This includes initiatives to reduce greenhouse emissions, decarbonize refining practices, and strategically eliminate tasks that historically required personnel to be in the line of fire of machinery. Through cutting-edge technology and forward-thinking solutions, we are committed to not only meeting but exceeding industry expectations.
							  <hr>
								<h3>Enhancing Public Acceptance Through Collaboration</h3>
								Recognizing the importance of community engagement, we propose a more integrated approach between the scientific team and Business Integrity & Compliance (BI&C). By closely collaborating with BI&C, the scientific team can actively seek feedback from the public and non-technical partners. This collaborative effort will allow us to refine safety procedures and technical solutions based on real-world perspectives, leading to a significant increase in public acceptance.
								<hr>
								<h3>Empowering the Next Generation</h3>
								In our commitment to fostering the next generation of scientists and engineers, we envision expanding our outreach to technical schools. Building on the success of our collaboration with the Colorado School of Mines, where we co-created educational content focused on equity and transitional training, we aim to replicate and extend similar partnerships. This strategic engagement with educational institutions is not only aimed at enriching academic experiences but also at shaping a diverse and highly skilled workforce for the future.

								<h3>Ramping up Hiring for Colorado School of Mines Graduates</h3>
								In line with our commitment to local talent development, Newmont is actively ramping up hiring efforts, with a specific focus on recruiting graduates from the esteemed Colorado School of Mines. The exceptional education and training provided by the Colorado School of Mines align seamlessly with our industry needs, making these graduates valuable additions to our team. Explore career opportunities and learn more about our engagement with the Colorado School of Mines in the relevant sections on our website.
							  
								Engaging with educational institutions and hiring graduates from such esteemed programs is not just a recruitment strategy; it's an investment in the future of our industry. Through innovation, collaboration, education, and strategic hiring, Newmont is steadfast in advancing safety, sustainability, and excellence within the extractives industry.
